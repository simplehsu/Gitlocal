= YubiHSM Setup

This tool allows to perform some administrative tasks with a YubiHSM.

The currently supported main functionalities are:
- Setup a device to use with the YubiHSM KSP for Windows ADCS
- Dump all the extractable objects from the device given an existing Wrap Key
- Restore exported object using a matching Wrap Key on a device
- Reset a device

== Building

To build the tool a normal Rust toolchain is required, stable
Rust will suffice.

The tools uses the `yubihsmrs` crate, which in turn requires
`libyubihsm` to be available.


=== Note about building

Currently `yubihsmrs` has not been published to crates.io. This means
that either a local or a git path should be specified when adding it
as dependency. Specifically, `yubihsm-setup` expects to find
`yubihsmrs` inside `../yubihsmrs/`.
